# 🫁 Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection

A deep learning project for detecting **Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images** using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning with **MobileNetV2**.

The project includes data exploration, image preprocessing, data augmentation, transfer learning, model training, evaluation, and a simple **Gradio web interface** for making predictions on new X-Ray images.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an image classification model that can classify chest X-ray images into two classes:

- **NORMAL**
- **PNEUMONIA**

The project uses the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset from Kaggle and applies Transfer Learning using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.

## 📂 Dataset

**Dataset:** Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)

**Source:** Kaggle  
**Dataset:** `paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia`

The dataset contains the following structure:

```text
chest_xray/
├── train/
│   ├── NORMAL/
│   └── PNEUMONIA/
├── val/
│   ├── NORMAL/
│   └── PNEUMONIA/
└── test/
    ├── NORMAL/
    └── PNEUMONIA/
```

The notebook creates the training and validation generators from the training directory using an **80/20 validation split**, while the test set is kept for final evaluation.

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MobileNetV2
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Gradio
- KaggleHub

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The X-Ray images are resized to:

```text
150 × 150
```

Pixel values are normalized using:

```python
rescale=1./255
```

### Data Augmentation

The training data uses:

- Rotation: `15°`
- Width shift: `0.1`
- Height shift: `0.1`
- Zoom: `0.15`
- Horizontal flipping
- Nearest-neighbor fill mode

A validation split of **20%** is created from the training data.

The test data is only rescaled and is not augmented.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The project uses **MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet** as the feature extraction backbone.

The original classification head is removed:

```python
MobileNetV2(
    weights='imagenet',
    include_top=False
)
```

The added classification layers are:

```text
MobileNetV2
     ↓
Global Average Pooling
     ↓
Dense(128, ReLU)
     ↓
Dropout(0.5)
     ↓
Dense(1, Sigmoid)
```

The MobileNetV2 base layers are initially frozen:

```python
base_model.trainable = False
```

### Compilation

```text
Loss       : Binary Crossentropy
Optimizer  : Adam
Learning Rate: 0.0001
Metric     : Accuracy
```

---

## 🏋️ Training

The model is trained for up to:

```text
15 epochs
```

Two callbacks are used:

### Early Stopping

Monitors validation loss and restores the best model weights:

```python
EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=8,
    restore_best_weights=True
)
```

### Reduce Learning Rate

Reduces the learning rate when validation loss stops improving:

```python
ReduceLROnPlateau(
    monitor='val_loss',
    factor=0.5,
    patience=3,
    min_lr=1e-7
)
```

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The notebook evaluates the model using:

- Validation Loss
- Validation Accuracy
- Test Loss
- Test Accuracy
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix

It also generates:

- Training vs. Validation Accuracy plot
- Training vs. Validation Loss plot
- Test-set Confusion Matrix

The classification report includes:

- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Support

### Results

Run the notebook to generate the latest evaluation metrics. The exact final test metrics are intentionally not hard-coded here because the notebook calculates them during execution.

---

## 💾 Saved Model

After training, the model is saved as:

```text
improved_cnn_model.h5
```

---

## 🌐 Gradio Interface

The project includes a simple Gradio interface that allows a user to upload a chest X-ray image and receive a prediction.

### Prediction Classes

```text
NORMAL
PNEUMONIA
```

The interface also displays the model's confidence score.

The image is resized to:

```text
150 × 150
```

and normalized before being passed to the model.

### Example Workflow

```text
Upload X-Ray
     ↓
Resize Image
     ↓
Normalize Pixels
     ↓
MobileNetV2 Model
     ↓
Prediction
     ↓
NORMAL / PNEUMONIA
```

The notebook launches Gradio with:

```python
interface.launch(share=True, debug=True)
```
